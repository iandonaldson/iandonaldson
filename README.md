# 👋 Hi, I'm Ian Donaldson. Welcome to my Github account!
### Enterprise Data Analytics & Strategy | Cross-functional team building | Translational Bioinformatics & Data Science | Generative AI and Research 

I use this area mostly for exploring new ideas and archiving past projects.   

I have previously worked as a biochemist, molecular biologist, bioinformatician, group lead and director of bioinformatics and data science groups within both industry and academia.  You can find out more about me using the links at the bottom of the page.  

Past interests have included working on protein interaction networks, text mining, human-in-the-loop, augmented-intelligence curation systems,
bioinformatics, data and process provenance tracking data integration systems, single-cell sequence analysis, machine learning and data science for translational biology.  

Currently I am exploring AI-driven research pipelines that employ reflection, tools, code-based planning and memory.   



🧠 **Currently exploring:** AI-driven research pipelines.  
📈 **Recent:** Wrapping up an agentic workflow in a robust development environment for GitHub Codespaces and Azure  
⚙️ **Tooling:** R | Python | Bash | Snakemake | PostgreSQL | GitHub Codespaces | Azure  
🔬 **Archived work:** PreBIND | IRefIndex
